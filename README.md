# Aura Runtime Environment
The Runtime is a platform codebase and rendering engine that focuses on maintaining classical Mozilla technologies and continuing them into the future. Sources for such continuation are independently developed but also sourced from many different places including Mozilla (for what little remains useful), as well as efforts around the global internet.

This repository also includes the Binary Outcast XUL-based applications.
