# Code of Conduct

Binary Outcast does not see a point in waving a big ol' CoC around. Just try to be somewhat of a decent human being to others.

### However...
If that is not specific enough or unclear how it relates to you, please feel free to substitute this with one of the many examples out there that other projects and organizations feel they have to draft, itemize, and mandate. Be warned though, this freedom to devise or use your own chosen "Code of Conduct" in place of BinOC mandating one does not in any way allow you to use that to otherwise interfere, hinder, or harm someone else. In that case, we fall back to case-by-case our decision is final .. mode.

Let's all try and avoid that. Shall we?
