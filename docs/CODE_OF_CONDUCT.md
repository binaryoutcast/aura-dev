# Code of Conduct

Binary Outcast does not see a point in waving a big ol' CoC around. Just try to be somewhat of a decent human being to others.

### However...
If that is not specific enough or is unclear how that relates to you, please, feel free to substitute this with one of myriad of examples out there that other projects and organizations feel they must draft, itemize, and mandate. One that you may already believe in and follow even when not required.

### Be warned...
This freedom to define or use your own chosen "Code of Conduct" in place of BinOC mandating one does not in any way entitle you to use that framework to otherwise interfere, hinder, or harm ANYONE else. In that event, we may fallback to the tried and true case-by-case/our decision is final method.

Let's all try and avoid that. Shall we?
